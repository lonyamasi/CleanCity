## DF: Waste Management
### DFL-1: Main Operations around waste pickup and handling
### DFL-1.1: Application accepts past dates and even last year for waste pickup scheduling
**Related Test Case**: TC-2.1 **Validate date must be at least 24h in future**  

### Description  
The waste pickup form allows users to select and submit a preferred pickup date that is in the past, including last year, which is illogical for future service requests.

### Steps to Reproduce  

1. Login as user Jay  
2. Submit a pickup request with:  
   - Location: Eldoret
   - Waste Type: Recyclable
   - Date: 2024-06-01  
3. Submit the request  
   

### Expected Result  
System should reject past dates with an error message as date input should be restricted to selection of today and the future.

### Actual Result  
System accepts and stores past dates like 2024-01-06 there are no restrictions on date picker or validation logic.

1. Login as user Jay  
2. Submit a pickup request with:  
   - Location: Eldoret  
   - Date: 2024-06-01  
3. Submit another identical request  
4. Check the request list or dashboard for duplicates

### Actual Result  
System accepts the duplicate request and assigns it a new request ID.

### DFL-1.3: User cannot Modify or Cancel Pickup Requests
**Related Test Case**: TC-2.3 **Manage Pickup Requests (Modify & Cancel)**

### Description  
The dashboard interface does not provide any options (buttons, links, or forms) for users to update or cancel pickup requests. This restricts the user from correcting mistakes (such as wrong date or location) or cancelling requests they no longer need. This directly affects user experience and system flexibility.

### Steps to Reproduce  

1. Log in as Clara.
2. Submit a pickup request with:  
   - Location: Eldoret  
   - Date: 2025-08-09 
3. Navigate to the Dashboard.
4. Try to modify or cancel the request.  

### Expected Result  
System lacks "Edit" button to update request details and "Cancel" button to delete pending requests.

### Actual Result  
System has no "Edit" button to modify request and has no "Cancel" button to delete the request.

**Related Test Case**: TC-2.4 **Track Requests Progress**

### Description

### Steps to Reproduce  

1. Log in as Clara
2. Submit a pickup request
3. Admin changes the request status to “Scheduled”.
4. Refresh Dashboard - Status text updates  

### Expected Result  
Progress indicator on user interface

### Actual Result  
The Admin gets an alert that status is updated but the user gets plain text status (“Scheduled”) only.

**Related Test Case: TC-3.2**
**Description**
The dashboard analytics section does not show the activities of the user.
